# Hybrid graph genome opens a new avenue for analyzing the allele-specific expressed genes

There are four reference genomes used in this study: (1) hap1 linear genome; (2) hap2-like hap1 linear pseudogenome; (3)graph genome with hap1 as backbone intergrating SNPs between hap1 and hap2 genome; (4) graph genome with hap1 as backbone intergrating SNPs and INDELs between hap1 and hap2 genome.
And this project is an example of above mentioned (4) circumstances. Other circumstances are in the similar ways.
Files under the '_scripts_' folder are custom scripts used in _graph.BM7.snp.and.indel.sh_.
